      <description>Problem:
Fatigue level is a psychological state which is difficult to gauge using non-invasive techniques. Data was taken from an existing research paper where 8 participants performed 3 different activities for 3 hours each. IMU and Heart Rate data was captured independent variables. RPE (Rating of Physical Exertion using Borg&amp;rsquo;s RPE scale) was used as dependent variable which was collected from each participant at 10 minutes time step.
Challenges:
 Data availability - Linear acceleration instead of triaxial acceleration.</description>
