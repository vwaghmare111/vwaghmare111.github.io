      <description>Multivariate stock price forecast model
 Daily data is used via Yahoo finance. Model is trained on 80% of the data. Significant lagged relationship between independent and dependent variables is identified. Number of forecast days is equal to number of significant lags. Model is mostly useful for swing traders usually with BTST (Buy today sell tomorrow) approach. Variables important to Value or Long term investors are not included.  Link to Web App</description>

      <description>Problem:
Fatigue level is a psychological state which is difficult to gauge using non-invasive techniques. Data was taken from an existing research paper where 8 participants performed 3 different activities for 3 hours each. IMU and Heart Rate data was captured independent variables. RPE (Rating of Physical Exertion using Borg’s RPE scale) was used as dependent variable which was collected from each participant at 10 minutes time step.
Source data is from the research paper &amp;ldquo;A data-driven approach to modeling physical fatigue in the workplace using wearable sensors&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Recently, Kaggle (a data science community and competition platform) released one data set &amp;lsquo;FIFA19‘, which consists of 18K+ FIFA 19 player with around 90 attributes extracted from FIFA database. In this assessment task, we make it available as the data set 2020T2Data.csv.
Tasks:
Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis Part 2: Clustering Analysis, and identify the position profiles of each cluster Part 3: Classification Analysis, and evaluate the performance of different algorithms using cross validation</description>

      <description>Objective of the data collection process Objective of the data collected for this experiment was Human Activity Recognition (HAR) which aims to identify the physical actions carried out by a person by sensing human body motion using smartphone’s (Galaxy S II smartphone) sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope).
  There were 30 subjects (individuals) within age bracket of 19-48 years who performed Activities of Daily Living (ADL) with a waist-mounted smartphone embedded with inertial sensors in laboratory set-up.</description>

      <description>Due to black swan events like COVID-19 which calls for desperate measures during desperate time, i.e. sealing International Australian borders. Education sector has huge financial setback which is third largest contributor to Australian GDP. Thus, forecasting number of international students in 2021 and 2022, we can estimate financial loss or opportunity forgone. Data was taken from below website along with ARIMA and LSTM models in Python.

      <description>Context
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another.</description>

      <description>Context
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando&amp;rsquo;s article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.</description>
